# Agile Quadrotor Simulation

## Description
This ROS package is meant to be used as a tool to test out several agile/aggressive maneuvers using a simulated model of a 
quadrotor. The simulation has been implemented in ROS-Gazebo simulation environment using PX4-SITL. The main objective of
this package is to provide a platform for testing out various trajectory generation techniques and control stratgies for
effectvely executing a manuever. More details about the working of each component of the algorithm is discussed in detail
in the wiki section of the project. Special mention is required for the package by Jaeyoung-Lim https://github.com/Jaeyoung-Lim/mavros_controllers. 

## Specifications
The simulation platform was designed and tested in the following work environment:
* Ubuntu 16.04 running on a system with Intel Core i7 CPU @ 2.20GHz Ã— 8 and 8GB RAM
* ROS Kinetic
* Gazebo 7.0.0
* PX4 SITL 


## Installation
The detailed instructions for setting up the simulation environement have been descirbed in the wiki associated with this project. The method of installation of the package will be descirbed here.
