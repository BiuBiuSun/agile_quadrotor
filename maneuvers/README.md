# Maneuvers

## Description
This package focuses on the trajectory generation for execting agile maneuvers. The agile maneuvers dealt with in this package are slit traversal, flip and ground vehicle tracking and landing. I would describe the mechanism for suitably adding other agile maneuvers. The file assocaited with each of these maneuvers mainly consists of the high level waypoint generation. The actaul task of generating the trajectory is acheived using the wonderful package mav_trajectory_generation
by ETH Zurich. The link to the package is https://github.com/ethz-asl/mav_trajectory_generation. More details on making use of the package can be found in the wiki.
